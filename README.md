## 🧠 Learnings & ⚠️ Challenges Faced

### 🎓 What I Learned:

- **Holistic Dashboard Design**: I discovered how balancing data density with readability is crucial in storytelling. It’s not just about including all charts—it’s about guiding the viewer’s eyes across a logical narrative.
- **Cross-Domain Insight Generation**: Drawing parallels between job market trends and healthcare data taught me how to build cross-domain visual narratives.
- **KPI Definition in Tableau**: Creating calculated fields and ensuring KPI consistency gave me hands-on experience in business metric design.
- **Word Cloud Implementation**: Mapping skill frequency in a visually digestible form using size as an indicator was both creative and informative.

### ⚠️ Difficulties Faced:

- **Dataset Alignment**: The healthcare and job market datasets were fundamentally different in structure and context. Merging insights without losing focus was a key challenge.
- **Story Flow**: Initially, the dashboard felt more like a collection of visualizations than a cohesive story. Iterative feedback and layout restructuring helped refine the narrative arc.
- **Design Constraints**: Balancing white space, alignment, and interactivity within Tableau’s constraints was an exercise in UI/UX thinking.
- **Label Clarity**: In bubble charts and heatmaps, avoiding label overlap and ensuring clarity across device resolutions required multiple tweaks.

These hurdles, while demanding, significantly contributed to my growth as a data storyteller and dashboard designer.
